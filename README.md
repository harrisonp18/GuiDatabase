# GuiDatabase
This is a short program that uses a Derby Embedded Batabase made with Apache as well as a GUI made with Gluon SceneBuilder.
Its only function at the moment is to connect to a database at the click of a button and to return wether or not the connection
was successful. Future functions will be to view the database as well as add and delete entries into it.
