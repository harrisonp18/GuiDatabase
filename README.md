# GuiDatabase
This is a short program that uses a Derby Embedded Batabase made with Apache as well as a GUI made with Gluon SceneBuilder.
Its only function at the moment is to connect to a database at the click of a button and to return wether or not the connection
was successful. Future functions will be to view the database as well as add and delete entries into it. It contains TextFields, TextArea, TableView, Label, Button, AnchorPane, GridPane, Seprator, a Circle, and a visual element from the JFoenix library that shows a ripple effect when a button is clicked.
